            Maxim Cypher is a creative platform where users can explore,
            download, and share AI-generated visuals and designs. It's built to

        <button class="accordion">Are the images really free to use?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            Many of our images are free to download and use for personal or
            commercial projects. However, access to premium or personalized
            AI-generated images requires a subscription plan. Subscribers
            receive exclusive content, higher-quality downloads, and the option
            to request custom visuals tailored to their needs.

          How long will it take to receive my custom image or video on the
          Creator or Pro subscription?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            Custom image requests are delivered quickly: if you’re on the
            <strong>Creator plan</strong>, you’ll receive your image within
            <strong>1 hour</strong>. On the <strong>Pro plan</strong>, images
            arrive even faster — typically within <strong>30 minutes</strong>.
            <br><br>
            Please note: custom videos are <strong>10 seconds long</strong> and
            may take a little extra time to process, but we work to deliver them
            as fast as possible.y

            you the ability to request custom images and videos.
