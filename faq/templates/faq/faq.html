          <p>
            Maxim Cypher is a premium AI content platform where professional prompt engineers create custom images and videos for you.
            Instead of spending hours crafting prompts or experimenting with tools, you simply submit your idea — and an expert designs a high-quality, polished image or 10-second video on your behalf.
            
            This saves you time, ensures professional results, and gives you content that stands out whether you’re a business, creator, or everyday user.

        <button class="accordion">Are the images really free to use?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            Many of our images are free to download and use for personal or
            commercial projects. However, access to premium or personalized
            AI-generated images requires a subscription plan. Subscribers
            receive exclusive content, higher-quality downloads, and the option
            to request custom visuals tailored to their needs.

          How long will it take to receive my custom image or video on the
          Creator or Pro subscription?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            Custom image requests are delivered quickly: if you’re on the
            <strong>Creator plan</strong>, you’ll receive your image within
            <strong>1 hour</strong>. On the <strong>Pro plan</strong>, images
            arrive even faster — typically within <strong>30 minutes</strong>.
            <br><br>
            Please note: custom videos are <strong>10 seconds long</strong> and
            may take a little extra time to process, but we work to deliver them
            as fast as possible.y

          Do I need to create an account to use the site?

          <p>
            No account is required to browse or download. However, signing up
            and subscribing to one of our plans unlocks premium images and gives
            you the ability to request custom images and videos.
